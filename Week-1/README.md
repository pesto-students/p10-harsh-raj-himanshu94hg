When a user enters a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) in a web browser, the browser goes through several steps to fetch the desired result. Here's a simplified diagram of the process:

The user enters a URL, such as https://www.example.com, in the address bar of the browser and hits Enter.
The browser parses the URL to extract the domain name (in this case, "example.com").
The browser sends a DNS (Domain Name System) request to a DNS server to resolve the domain name to an IP address. The DNS server returns the IP address associated with the domain name.
The browser establishes a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection with the server at the IP address.
The browser sends an HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request to the server, specifying the resource (e.g., the web page) that the user wants to access.
The server receives the HTTP request and responds with an HTTP response, which includes the requested resource.
The browser receives the HTTP response and parses the HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) code to construct a Document Object Model (DOM) tree, which represents the structure of the web page.
The browser uses the CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) code to apply styles to the elements in the DOM tree, and renders the web page on the screen.
This process is simplified and there may be additional steps involved, such as SSL/TLS handshake for secure connections, caching, and compression. Nonetheless, the diagram above provides a basic overview of how a web browser fetches a web page when a user enters a URL.
